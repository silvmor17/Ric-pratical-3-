B. Write a program for t-test comparing two means for independent samples.
The t distribution provides a good way to perform one sample tests on the mean when
the population variance is not known provided the population is normal or the sample
is sufficiently large so that the Central Limit Theorem applies.
Two Sample t Test
Example: A college Princiapal informed classroom teachers that some of their students
showedunusual potential for intellectual gains. One months later the students identified
to teachers ashaving potentional for unusual intellectual gains showed significiantly
greater gains performanceon a test said to measure IQ than did students who were not so
identified. Below are the data forthe students:

Experimental Data
To calculate Standard Mean go to cell A22 and type =SUM(A2:A21)/20
To calculate Standard Deviation go to cell A23 and type =STDEV(A2:A21)
Comparison Data
To calculate Standard Mean go to cell B22 and type =SUM(B2:B21)/20

To calculate Standard Deviation go to cell B23 and type =STDEV(B2:B21)
To find T-Test Statistics go to data Data Analysis
To caluculate the T-Test square value go to cell E20 and type
=(A22-B22)/SQRT((A23*A23)/COUNT(A2:A21)+(B23*B23)/COUNT(A2:A21))
Now go to cell E20 and type
=IF(E20<E12,"H0 is Accepted", "H0 is Rejected and H1 is Accepted")
Our calculated value is larger than the tabled value at alpha = .01, so we reject the null
hypothesisand accept the alternative hypothesis, namely, that the difference in gain
scores is likely the resultof the experimental treatment and not the result of chance
variation.
