C. Perform testing of hypothesis using paired t-test. The paired sample t-test is also called dependent sample t-test. It’s an univariate test that
tests for a significant difference between 2 related variables. An example of this is if you
where to collect the blood pressure for an individual before and after some treatment,
condition, or time point. The data set contains blood pressure readings before and after
an intervention. These are variables “bp_before” and “bp_after”.
The hypothesis being test is:
• H0 - The mean difference between sample 1 and sample 2 is equal to 0.
• H0 - The mean difference between sample 1 and sample 2 is not equal to 0

Output:

A paired sample t-test was used to analyze the blood pressure before and after the
intervention to test if the intervention had a significant affect on the blood pressure. The
blood pressure before the intervention was higher (156.45 ± 11.39 units) compared to
the blood pressure post intervention (151.36 ± 14.18 units); there was a statistically
significant decrease in blood pressure (t(119)=3.34, p= 0.0011) of 5.09 units.
